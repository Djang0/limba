Hi all. 

I'm experiencing an error with the garbage collection when using session library. It happens randomly and not that often but it happens :)

The error is:

session_start() [function.session-start]: ps_files_cleanup_dir: opendir(/var/lib/php5) failed: Permission denied (13)

I google a while to solve this problem and I found this:

Frustratingly, if you do receive this error, you'll only get it once every hundred page loads on average. Which points to the cause of the problem: automatic session garbage collection. In Debian and Ubuntu, /var/lib/php5, where the session data is stored, has permissions of drwx-wx-wt and should only be cleaned by a cron script.

Solutions found among others:
- Prefixing the session call with '@' 
- change the group to www-data and grant group read permissions with "chmod g+r" (slightly more secure than the one below)
- change the directory permissions to be world-readable
- disable garbage collection in the session config file

Any thoughts on this? Did someone got the same error?
